# Latex Examples

This repository is a collection of TeX and LaTeX code examples, snippets and gists.

I use them
+ for learning TeX and LaTeX
* for my own testing purposes
* as illustrations for courses
* as suggestions for my students
* for all kinds of other purposes :-)

I offer them here on public display for the benefit of all who want to benefit from them.

Many files form part of my German speaking LaTeX course, so they are in German.

If you use larger portions of the repository or use my style files or packages in a longer document, 
you are welcome to leave a short acknowledgment somewhere in the document and link to this repository.
Legally speaking, this is subject to the LPPL Version 1.3c  2008-05-04.

Questions, suggestions and remarks are welcome in the issues section.

## Note for using these files 

I am using the following conventions in my LaTeX compilation environment. It is recommended to
follow a similar setup or the files might not be found.

* Every directory with *.tex files contains a `build/` directory, which is used a build directory.
* Every directory with *.tex files contains a `images/`directory, which keeps image files for inclusion in the TeX.
* In some cases, *.tex files may refer to files in `build/` directories.
